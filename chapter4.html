                <h3>Finding Our Rhythm</h3>
                <p>The early years of marriage brought unexpected challenges and surprising joys. We learned to navigate the mundane aspects of life together—dividing chores, managing finances, and finding the delicate balance between togetherness and independence.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget the Sunday morning tradition we established: fresh coffee, homemade pancakes, and solving the crossword puzzle together. Or how we discovered that you're the one who keeps plants alive while I'm better at organizing our spaces. The way we complement each other in these small ways feels like proof that we were meant to find one another.</p>
                <p>We've supported each other through career changes, health scares, and family difficulties. Through it all, we've learned that growth isn't always comfortable, but facing life's challenges side by side has strengthened our bond in ways we never could have imagined.</p>
