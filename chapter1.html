                <h3>How We Met</h3>
                <p>It was a sunny afternoon in June when we first crossed paths. The park was bustling with people enjoying the perfect weather, but somehow among the crowd, our eyes met.</p>
                <p>You were reading your favorite book under that old oak tree, and I was walking my friend's dog who, as fate would have it, decided to make a beeline straight for you. What started as an awkward apology turned into hours of conversation.</p>
                <p>Little did we know that this chance encounter would be the beginning of our story together.</p>

                <p>"Sometimes you meet someone, and it's so clear that the two of you, on some level belong together. As lovers, or as friends, or as family, or as something entirely different. You just work, whether you understand one another or you're in love or you're partners in crime. You meet these people throughout your life, out of nowhere, under the strangest circumstances, and they help you feel alive."</p>
