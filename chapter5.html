                <h3>The Road Ahead</h3>
                <p>As we look toward our future together, we've filled pages with dreams both big and small. There's the cabin by the lake we hope to build someday, a place where we can watch sunsets from the porch and welcome friends and family for long weekends.</p>
                <p>We've talked about visiting all seven continents, with Antarctica being the final frontier on our travel bucket list. And the community garden project we want to start in our neighborhood, bringing people together through growing food and flowers.</p>
                <p>Perhaps what excites us most about the future isn't any specific plan or destination—it's the knowledge that whatever comes next, we'll face it together. The best chapters of our story are still waiting to be written, and there's no one I'd rather write them with than you.</p>
